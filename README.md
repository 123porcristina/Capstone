 Traffic accidents are responsible for 1.25 million deaths worldwide and is the fifth
leading cause of death in the US (Global Status Report on Road Safety 2015, 2015). Injuries and
costs associated with traffic accidents have a large impact on the individuals involved and the
communities they live in. While there is a lot of current research on different modeling
techniques in the Machine Learning and Deep Learning disciplines, there is still a need for
further exploration in how these modeling techniques compare to one another when predicting
accident risk and severity.

 This project aims to test several machine learning, time series, and deep learning models
in order to decipher which modelling techniques have the best outcomes for predicting traffic
accident risk and severity. Armed with the best modelling techniques, stakeholders such as city
officials, insurance companies, and hospitals can make more informed and perhaps improved
decisions related to traffic accident preparedness. The remainder of this article is as follows. The
second section is a discussion of current research related to this area of study. The third section
discusses methodology including a description of the dataset and data preprocessing techniques.
The fourth section discusses the results of the different modeling techniques and the final section
summarizes our conclusions and ideas on further research.
